# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
"ðŸš€ Just completed Task-2 at Bharat Intern: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM ðŸ“ˆðŸ”®

In this project, I ventured into the exciting world of time series analysis and deep learning to build a robust Stock Price Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Along this journey, I gained invaluable insights and knowledge:

ðŸ“Š Explored the intricacies of time series data, understanding its unique characteristics and challenges.
ðŸ§¹ Mastered data preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset for modeling.
ðŸ§  Tuned and optimized the LSTM model for better accuracy and predictive power.
ðŸ“ˆ Embraced the significance of historical data in forecasting future stock prices.

This project was not just about completing a task; it was about continuous learning and growth in the field of data science and machine learning. Every line of code, every parameter tuned, and every plot analyzed brought me closer to becoming a better data scientist.

Join me on this journey of exploration and learning by exploring the code and documentation in this repository. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve in the world of data science! ðŸŒŸ
